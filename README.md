# Color Segementation


Readme

  - Use label.py to circle out the labels like barrel blue, not barrel blue
  - Use parameters.py to compute the paremeters form Maximum Likelihood Estimation, including mean and covariance.
  - Use BDR.py to compute PDF of sigle Gaussian model and classify each pixel to barrel or not barrel through Bayes Decision Rule. Save the result as result_mask.npy.
  - Use Bounding Box.py to print the bounding boxes on pictures and output the coordinate of bounding boxes.
  - Use barrel_detector.py to run main function and print out the result of pictures you wants to segment.
